# Order - placing the order by giving:
# the list of dishes,
# their quantities
# a number that should be the exact total.
# If the sum does not meet the minimum delivery cost the method should raise an error,
# otherwise the customer is sent a text saying that the order was placed successfully and that it will be delivered 1 hour from now, e.g. "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52".

# The text sending functionality should be implemented using Twilio API. You'll need to register for it. Itâ€™s free.
# Use twilio-ruby gem to access the API
# Use a Gemfile to manage your gems

# Make sure that your Takeaway is thoroughly tested and that you use mocks and/or stubs, as necessary to not to send texts when your tests are run
# However, if your Takeaway is loaded into IRB and the order is placed, the text should actually be sent
# Phone
